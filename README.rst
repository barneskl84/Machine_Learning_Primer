Description
------------

This repository contains files to supplement the lecture I am giving for the Data Science Colorado Meetup group on July 1st, 2015 at Galvanize Platte

Package Versions used for Python Scripts
----------------------------------
* Python 2.7.9
* NumPy 1.9.2
* Matplotlib 1.4.3

I haven't checked compatibility with other versions.  I strongly recommend downloading the `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. stack.  It will provide you with everything required to run the scripts in this repo.

Summary of Scripts
------------------
