Description
------------

This repository contains files to supplement the lecture I am giving for the Data Science Colorado Meetup group on July 1st, 2015 at Galvanize Platte

Package Versions used for Python Scripts
----------------------------------
* Python 2.7.9
* NumPy 1.9.2
* Matplotlib 1.4.3

I haven't checked compatibility with other versions.  I strongly recommend downloading the `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. stack.  It will provide you with everything required to run the scripts in this repo.

Summary of Scripts
------------------

gradient_descent_button
	This is a Python script that shows gradient descent against the plot of f(x) = (x - 5)^2.  You press enter to step through the algorithm or 'q' to quit (may have to enter it a couple times in a row).
	
display_linefit_graphic
	This is a Python script that displays 4 regression line plots to compare how well a line will fit the data based upon the M and B variables
